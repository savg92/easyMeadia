# Angular Publication System

This project is an Angular application that allows registered users to publish messages and search for messages published by other users.

## Project Structure

The project has the following file structure:

```
my-angular-app
├── src
│   ├── app
│   │   ├── components
│   │   │   ├── home
│   │   │   ├── login
│   │   │   ├── messages
│   │   │   ├── navbar
│   │   │   ├── publish
│   │   │   └── search
│   │   ├── models
│   │   ├── services
│   │   ├── app-routing.module.ts
│   │   ├── app.component.html
│   │   ├── app.component.ts
│   │   ├── app.component.css
│   │   ├── app.module.ts
│   │   └── main.ts
│   ├── assets
│   ├── environments
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── favicon.ico
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

The `src` folder contains the source code of the application. The `app` folder contains the components, models, and services used by the application. The `assets` folder contains the static assets used by the application, such as images and fonts. The `environments` folder contains the environment configurations for the application. The `index.html` file is the main HTML file of the application. The `styles.css` file contains the global CSS styles for the application. The `favicon.ico` file is the icon of the application.

## Components

The application has the following components:

- `HomeComponent`: displays the home page of the application.
- `LoginComponent`: displays the login form.
- `MessagesComponent`: displays the messages published by the user.
- `NavbarComponent`: displays the navigation bar of the application.
- `PublishComponent`: displays the form to publish a message.
- `SearchComponent`: displays the search form.

## Models

The application has the following models:

- `Message`: defines the structure of a message object.
- `User`: defines the structure of a user object.

## Services

The application has the following services:

- `AuthService`: handles the authentication process.
- `MessageService`: handles the message-related operations.
- `UserService`: handles the user-related operations.

## Routing

The application uses the `AppRoutingModule` to define the routes of the application. The routes are:

- `/home`: displays the home page.
- `/login`: displays the login form.
- `/messages`: displays the messages published by the user.
- `/publish`: displays the form to publish a message.
- `/search`: displays the search form.

## Entry Point

The entry point of the application is the `main.ts` file, which bootstraps the `AppModule`.

## Development

To run the application in development mode, run the following command:

```
ng serve
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```
ng build --prod
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the production build of the application.

## Conclusion

This Angular application allows registered users to publish messages and search for messages published by other users. It uses components, models, and services to implement the functionality, and routing to navigate between the different views.
